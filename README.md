This is a project for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001">Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree</a> provided by <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>

In this project, I was provided with a design mockup as a picture (page-mock.png) and I was required to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. 

According to the auto-grading system, my code achieved a mismatch rate of 0.87%. 

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.txt".
